## Explanation

This is a _Recipe Finder_ web app that I built with **React.js**.

**Topics:** React Hooks, components, props, useState(), useEffect() with managing dependencies, Context API, handling HTML input in React. Fetch API, JS Promises, and callback. TailwindCSS styling with flexbox and grid.

I embarked on this project as a series of practice exercises after dedicating a couple of years to learning front-end web development. My goal was twofold: to enhance my coding skills and bolster my resume, ultimately preparing myself for the job market.

Project number: 12
